# c-cpp-profi pre-commit hook (portable template)
#
# Installs as a git pre-commit hook in a consumer repo. It runs the skill's
# read-only risk scan over the staged C/C++ files and prints a reminder to fill
# and --derive-profiles-validate a gate report before handoff.
#
# Install (from the repo root, with the skill vendored at skill/c-cpp-profi/):
#   ln -s ../../skill/c-cpp-profi/assets/ci/pre-commit-c-cpp-profi.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
# or copy it:
#   cp skill/c-cpp-profi/assets/ci/pre-commit-c-cpp-profi.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
#   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
#
# Locate the skill: by default this hook looks for the skill at
# skill/c-cpp-profi relative to the repo root. Override with the CPP_PROFI_DIR
# env var, e.g. in .git/hooks/pre-commit or your shell:
#   CPP_PROFI_DIR=vendor/c-cpp-profi git commit ...
#
# Exit policy: this hook is ADVISORY. The risk scan's findings (raw strcpy,
# malloc, casts, threading primitives, etc.) are triage prompts, not commit
# blockers, so a clean scan and a scan with findings BOTH exit 0. The hook only
# exits non-zero on a HARD ERROR: the configured skill directory or the risk-scan
# script is missing, or rg is not installed (the scan cannot run at all). This
# keeps the hook from silently passing while doing nothing.

c-cpp-profi reminder: the scan above is advisory triage, not a verdict.
Before handoff, fill a gate report and validate it:
  bash CPP_PROFI_DIR/scripts/cpp_gate_report.sh . > gate-report.md
  # fill in the Change Scope answers (yes/no) and every gate row, then:
  python3 CPP_PROFI_DIR/scripts/cpp_evidence_check.py gate-report.md --derive-profiles
(substitute CPP_PROFI_DIR with your skill path; default skill/c-cpp-profi)
